2. **Difficult to Search**: ✅ SOLVED - Structured data with all mall attributes for advanced filtering (78+ tenants per mall, detailed property specs)
3. **Not Machine-Readable**: ✅ SOLVED - Clean JSON/CSV/SQLite exports ready for automated processing with enhanced metadata
4. **Time-Consuming to Access**: ✅ SOLVED - Automated extraction of 700+ malls in minutes vs. hours of manual work (2.2x faster performance)

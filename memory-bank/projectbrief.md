## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Complete MECSR directory scraping (https://www.mecsr.org/directory-shopping-centres)
- Individual listing detail extraction
- Data validation and cleaning
- Multiple export format support
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Local environment setup with .venv and uv

### Out of Scope
- Real-time data updates (one-time extraction)
- MECSR member login functionality
- Other MECSR website sections (events, jobs, etc.)
- Data analysis or visualization
- API endpoint creation for extracted data

## Technical Foundation
- **Primary Technology**: Crawl4AI (LLM-friendly web crawler & scraper)
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Environment Management**: `.venv` virtual environment with `uv` package manager
- **Architecture**: Async-first, modular design
- **Data Processing**: Pydantic for validation, Pandas for manipulation
- **Storage**: JSON file output (expandable to other formats later)
- **Deployment**: Local execution with .venv environment

## Key Stakeholders
- **Project Owner**: Data extraction requirements
- **Technical Lead**: Architecture and implementation decisions
- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation and testing
- **End Users**: Data consumers requiring structured mall information

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Site structure changes requiring code updates
- **Medium Risk**: Rate limiting or anti-bot measures
- **Low Risk**: Network connectivity issues (handled by retry logic)
- **Low Risk**: Data volume handling (1,001 records is manageable)

## Timeline & Milestones (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Site scoping & discovery (COMPLETED - 696+ URLs discovered)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Advanced scraper implementation (COMPLETED - Production-ready with async batching)
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Enhanced data extraction & optimization (COMPLETED - Post Details, tenants, images, 2.2x performance)
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Production testing & deployment (COMPLETED - 100% success rate, comprehensive data coverage)
- **Total Timeline**: 6-9 business days (ALL MAJOR OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED)

**Production-Ready Features** (All Implemented):
- ✅ Enhanced data extraction (Post Details table, 78+ tenant lists, 47+ property images)
- ✅ Aggressive performance optimization (2.2x faster, 0.64 req/sec throughput)
- ✅ Advanced async batch processing with semaphore control (15 concurrent requests)
- ✅ Comprehensive property information extraction (GLA, stores, parking, coordinates)
- ✅ External URL extraction from "More Details" buttons and structured data
- ✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, SQLite) with comprehensive metadata
- ✅ Production-grade error handling with 100% success rate and resume capability
- ✅ Performance monitoring and rich progress tracking

## Budget Considerations (YAGNI-Optimized)
- **Development Time**: 6-9 days for MVP
- **Infrastructure**: Standard development workstation with Python 3.11+
- **Tools**: `uv` package manager installation and setup
- **Storage**: ~1GB for extracted JSON data
- **Maintenance**: As-needed updates based on site changes
- **No External APIs**: All processing done locally

## Compliance & Ethics
- **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to website terms of service and robots.txt
- **Ethical Scraping**: Implement responsible rate limiting and user agent identification
- **Data Privacy**: Handle location and contact data appropriately
- **Attribution**: Properly credit MECSR as data source

## Success Metrics (ACHIEVED)
- **Quantitative**: ✅ 696+ listings discovered and collectable, 100% success rate, 2.2x performance improvement (0.64 req/sec)
- **Enhanced Data Coverage**: ✅ Post Details table, 78+ tenant lists, 47+ property images, comprehensive structured data
- **Qualitative**: ✅ Clean, well-structured codebase, comprehensive documentation, reliable production operation
- **Business Value**: ✅ Complete, accurate dataset with detailed property information for retail industry analysis
- **Performance**: ✅ Aggressive optimization with intelligent rate limiting (45 req/min, 15 concurrent)
